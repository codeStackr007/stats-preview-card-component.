- **Accent**: `hsl(277, 64%, 61%)` - Vibrant purple
- **Text**: White with varying opacity levels (100%, 75%, 60%)

### Layout Philosophy

- **Stats Layout**: Horizontal row layout for better visual balance and professional appearance
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting from mobile and scaling up
- **Centered Content**: Card centered in viewport with proper spacing
